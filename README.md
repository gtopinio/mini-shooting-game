This Java Project integrates the object-oriented programming concepts to simulate an intricate yet straightforward GUI mini-shooting game.

This mini-shooting game application is called “Super Dead Gunner,” inspired by a Game Assets Artist, Emcee Flesher. 
Super Dead Gunner is a simple retro-style 2D pixel shooter that lets players control a ship using WASD or Arrow keys. 
The player can also shoot using the spacebar key and annihilate incoming alien ships from the right side of the screen to gain points. 
Power-ups also spawn to support the player’s ship along the way. Every game instance lasts for one minute, and the player’s ship must survive until then. 
There’s also an alien boss ship that might come as a hindrance to the player.

Super Dead Gunner is developed using Eclipse, and the game assets are mostly edited in Photoshop. 
The base code is also provided by the Institute of Computer Science  (University of the Philippines Los Banos).
Some of the challenges faced during game development are the elusive bugs in the game mechanics and animation. 
For example, before the refined implementations, when a player tries to shoot, multiple bullet instances are created, which doesn’t make any sense.
There are some features that I hope to implement in the future, like adding more variants of the sprites and improving the game status bar, which should also include a health bar for the boss. I would also like to improve the game application aesthetics, especially in the instructions and about-the-developer menu.


**How to Install/Run the Game Application:**

The game is playable using an IDE like Eclipse, an integrated development environment used in Java. 
Download all the files from the repository and import them to your preferred IDE. 
You can also skip the other files and download the music files first and then the src files, which contains the essential Java files to run the game.
